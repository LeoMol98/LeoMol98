    Wholse Numbers:
    byte -> 8 bits  - only store values between -126 abd 127
    short -> 16 bits
    char -> 16 bits (but it's only positive numbers)
    int -> 32 bits
    long -> 64 bits
    
    
    Decimal Numbers: (1.05, 400.00)
    float 
    double
    
    Other:
    boolean - stores true or false (which are keywords in Java)
