Hello World - This is my first test outside of Class on edditing a 
document with nano in git bash

Lets Put Some Instructions on How to use this thing and how to use the
command line or in this Case git bash

List of Codes Most used:

"cd" is used to change directory, meaning to change from one folder to
another

"mkdir" is to make new directories

"pwd" is to print the working directotry source in which you're in

"git add ."
"git commit"
"git push"
"git pull"

cat - the concatenate command prints the contents of a file to the console. cat hello.txt
head - the head command prints the first ten lines of a file to the console. head hello.txt
tail - the tail command prints the last ten lines of a file to the console. tail hello.txt

mv - the move command will rename or move a file or entire directory with the recursive flag.
